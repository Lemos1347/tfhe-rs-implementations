This repository contains examples and applications demonstrating the power of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) using the [TFHE-rs](https://github.com/zama-ai/tfhe-rs) library. The examples showcase how to perform computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it.

## ‚ú® What is Fully Homomorphic Encryption?

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a revolutionary cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data. The results of these computations, when decrypted, match the results of the same operations performed on the original, unencrypted data.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Client["Client (has secret key)"]
        A[Plaintext Data] -->|Encrypt| B[Encrypted Data]
        G[Encrypted Result] -->|Decrypt| H[Plaintext Result]
    end
    
    subgraph Server["Server (computation without secret key)"]
        C[Encrypted Data] -->|Homomorphic Operations| D[Encrypted Result]
    end
    
    B --> C
    D --> G
```

With FHE:
- Data remains encrypted throughout the entire computation process
- The party performing the computation never sees the actual data
- The results are only accessible to those with the decryption key

## üßÆ Understanding the Mathematics Behind TFHE

TFHE (Torus Fully Homomorphic Encryption) is an FHE scheme based on learning with errors (LWE) and its ring variant (RLWE). Let's dive deep into how it works, starting from first principles.

### Fundamental Cryptographic Building Blocks

TFHE builds on several cryptographic primitives:

#### Learning With Errors (LWE)

At its core, TFHE uses the Learning With Errors problem, which is believed to be resistant to quantum computing attacks.

The basic LWE encryption of a message `m` looks like this:

```
c = (a, b = <a,s> + e + m)
```

Where:
- `a` is a random vector
- `s` is the secret key
- `e` is a small error/noise term
- `<a,s>` is the dot product of vectors `a` and `s`

This construction has the remarkable property that:
- Adding two ciphertexts results in the encryption of the sum
- Multiplying by a plaintext constant works directly

#### The Torus Representation

>[!NOTE]
>TFHE uses a mathematical structure called a torus (T = ‚Ñù/‚Ñ§, the real numbers modulo 1) to represent messages.

In practical terms, this means working with fractional values in [0,1) where arithmetical operations wrap around like on a circle. For implementation purposes, these values are discretized using fixed-point arithmetic.

```
T = {x ‚àà ‚Ñù | 0 ‚â§ x < 1}
```

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Torus["Torus Representation T = ‚Ñù/‚Ñ§"]
        circle(((" "))) --- c0["0.0"]
        circle --- c1["0.25"]
        circle --- c2["0.5"]
        circle --- c3["0.75"]
        c3 --- c0
    end
    
    subgraph Encoding["Integer Encoding"]
        m0["0"] -.-> c0
        m1["1"] -.-> c1
        m2["2"] -.-> c2
        m3["3"] -.-> c3
    end
```

This representation offers two key advantages:
1. It enables efficient implementation of bootstrapping
2. It naturally handles the cyclic behavior required for homomorphic operations

### Encryption and Noise Management

When encrypting in TFHE:

1. **Encoding**: First, the plaintext message is encoded into the torus representation
   ```
   m_encoded = encode(m) ‚àà T
   ```

2. **Encryption**: Then, the encoded message is encrypted using LWE
   ```
   c = (a, b = <a,s> + e + m_encoded)
   ```

3. **Noise Growth**: Each homomorphic operation increases noise:
   - Addition: The noise terms add linearly
     ```
     noise(c‚ÇÅ + c‚ÇÇ) ‚âà noise(c‚ÇÅ) + noise(c‚ÇÇ)
     ```
   - Multiplication: Noise grows quadratically
     ```
     noise(c‚ÇÅ ¬∑ c‚ÇÇ) ‚âà noise(c‚ÇÅ) ¬∑ noise(c‚ÇÇ)
     ```

Once noise exceeds a certain threshold, the ciphertext can no longer be correctly decrypted.

### Bootstrapping: The Core of TFHE

Bootstrapping is the critical operation that makes TFHE fully homomorphic by allowing an unlimited number of operations.

In technical terms, bootstrapping:
1. Takes a ciphertext with large noise
2. Homomorphically evaluates the decryption function using an encryption of the secret key
3. Produces a fresh ciphertext with the same plaintext but reduced noise

This can be expressed as:
```
bootstrap(c) = Homomorphic-Eval(Dec, Enc(sk), c) = fresh_c
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Input["Input Ciphertext"]
        A[Ciphertext c] --> B["Noisy (approaching threshold)"]
    end
    
    subgraph Bootstrap["Bootstrapping Process"]
        C["Encrypted Secret Key"] 
        D["Homomorphic Decryption Circuit"]
        E["Apply Function f (optional)"]
    end
    
    subgraph Output["Output Ciphertext"]
        F["Fresh Ciphertext c'"] --> G["Reduced Noise"]
    end
    
    B --> D
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
```

TFHE implements this efficiently through:

1. **Key Switching**: Transforms a ciphertext encrypted under one key to encryption under another key
2. **Programmable Bootstrapping**: Allows evaluating arbitrary functions during the bootstrapping process
3. **FFT Acceleration**: Uses the Fast Fourier Transform to speed up polynomial multiplications

### The Programmable Bootstrapping Technique

A key innovation in TFHE is programmable bootstrapping, which:
- Combines bootstrapping with function evaluation
- Allows arbitrary lookup tables to be computed homomorphically
- Enables efficient implementation of non-linear functions

This is achieved by approximating functions with trigonometric polynomials during the bootstrapping operation.

```
PBS(c, f) = Bootstrapped ciphertext encoding f(Dec(c))
```

### Integer Operations in TFHE-rs

TFHE-rs implements integer operations by working with individual bits or small integer chunks:

- For small integers: Direct encoding on the torus
- For larger integers: Decomposition into multiple ciphertexts (bit-slicing or digit-decomposition)

The following operations are implemented efficiently:
- Addition and subtraction (relatively low noise growth)
- Multiplication (implemented via binary decomposition and additions)
- Comparisons (implemented using subtraction and sign extraction)
- Logical operations (implemented via lookup tables)

## üí° The Fibonacci Example Explained

The Fibonacci example provides an excellent case study for understanding TFHE operations:

### 1. Key Generation
```rust
let config = ConfigBuilder::default().build();
let (client_key, server_key) = generate_keys(config);
```

This creates:
- A secret key for encryption/decryption (client_key)
- A public key for homomorphic operations (server_key)

### 2. Encryption
```rust
let a = FheUint32::try_encrypt(0u32, &self.client_key);
let b = FheUint32::try_encrypt(1u32, &self.client_key);
```

Here we encrypt the initial Fibonacci values (0 and 1) using:
- `FheUint32` - a 32-bit unsigned integer representation
- The client's encryption key

### 3. Homomorphic Computation
```rust
for i in 2..k {
    let next = &a + &b;
    a = b;
    b = next.clone();
    sequence.push(next);
}
```

Each addition:
- Performs element-wise addition of the ciphertexts
- Triggers an automatic bootstrapping if noise levels get too high
- Produces a new encrypted Fibonacci number without ever decrypting

### 4. Decryption
```rust
sequence.iter().map(|x| x.decrypt(&self.client_key)).collect()
```

Only at the end do we decrypt the results using the client key.

### Performance Considerations

The benchmark tracks:
- Key generation time (typically 500-600ms)
- Encryption time (1-2ms per value)
- Homomorphic addition time (150-200ms per operation)
- Decryption time (negligible compared to operations)

The significant time spent in homomorphic operations is due to the bootstrapping process, which involves complex mathematical operations to manage noise.

## üìä Available Examples

### 1. Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci example demonstrates how to compute a sequence of numbers where each is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1:

```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
```

In this example:
- We generate encryption and decryption keys
- Encrypt the initial values (0 and 1)
- Perform homomorphic additions to compute subsequent Fibonacci numbers
- Decrypt the final sequence to verify correctness
